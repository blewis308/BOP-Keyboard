# Build Guide:

### Step 1: Diodes
#### Estimated Time: 2-3 hours
Start by orienting the PCB so that you can read "Design by Fruitykeeb" straight on. Next, place a small amound of solder the pad opposite to the "K" on each of the diode locations. There are 120 to do.

Next, using tweezers or something similar, grab one diode and heat the bit of solder you just placed. Once the solder starts to melt, slide the diode into position. *Make sure the line on the diode is facing the "K" on the footprint. If it is not, key presses will not register!*
